  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center word-wrap: break-word;"> <i>Drums are an extremely old instrument dating back to around 6000BC. Of course, back then drums would have looked a lot different to what they are now however the basic philosophy is the same. <br>Before the modern era, the Drum Kit was split up into different pieces so different people were playing a different part of the Drums. This proved ineffective later, and as musicians started to get paid more and<br> more it was proved too expensive as well. It wasn’t until 1930 until the Drum Kit we know today was finalized on and used by the majority of musicians. Even today though there are different types of drum kits <br> that may seem a bit different to normal. The drum kit contains three essential parts and then some less important parts the three we will talk about below in further detail. However, why is it important to learn <br>drums isn't this just a
waste of my time that I could be using to do something productive? Well, the drums have revealed to have benefits to your brain and muscular memory system. Also learning an instrument,<br> in general,
can not only help you get smarter but also help with stress anger management. Drums are one of the more simplier instruments and require less practice daily and less commitment then other<br> more difficult intruments. Learning an instrument is a great hobby that can be very entertaining and a skill you keep for life.</i> </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"> <center>Below we see the three main parts of the drum kit the high hat, (right) the snare drum (centre) and the bass drum (left)</center></p>
    <p class="w3-justify>"> These three parts of the instrument can be combined to create a basic beat however we will talk about this further later. There are of course other parts of the drum kits however when beginning to play they are not as important as these three. There are many different types of drum kits normally to match the genre or difficulty you are playing, however, they almost always contain these three parts so it is important to know how to use them and what they do, which I will go into in further detail below. The other parts of the drum kit are the tom toms, the ride cymbal and the crash cymbal. These are part of the drum kit however are not  </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">How to Play</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"> <i>Using the three instruments we talked about above we can start playing some basic stuff. However, to play the drums properly we need to understand how music works in terms of beats in a bar. There are 4 beats <br>in a bar and different types of notes will take up a different quantity of beats. For example, a quarter note will take up one-quarter of a bar which is one beat. An eighth note would take up one eight of a bar.<br> A basic drum beat, also shown in the image below,(right) contains the three instruments I stated above. However, on the sheet music, it is difficult to determine which one is which. The high one is the high hat<br> or the one with an x. The middle one is the snare drum and the bottom one is the bass drum. If you play the hi-hat as eight notes then play the snare drum and bass drum alternating on the quarter notes you will <br>get the basic beat.  </i></p>
